# TODO - LIST FOR THE PYTHON BOT
## What to do with Project Py?

### FINISHING THE BOT
This is going to be a while... Before that I need to complete the following tasks below me.

#### EXTRA HANDS
- Find another maintainer. `-PRIORITY!-`
- Get some quality assurance. (Almost there...)
#### REFRACTORING

- Sort out the documentation.

- Refractor a lot of code.

- Something that has been bothering me is that I can not use a class with my roundtrip. `-PRIORITY!-`

#### GELBOORU TASK
- Set classes with the gelbooru imports.
    When requesting, I should do something like this.
    Class.GIF()
    Calling a function to grab my gif images to clean clutter.

- Add more Gelbooru commands.
- Find a good handler with an explicit rating to safe `-PRIORITY!-`

#### FRIENDS IDEAS
- What else? Maybe some more command ideas.
- I'll try to find some from my friends.
